# School_District_Analysis
Project using anaconda, python and pandas
## Overview of the school district analysis:
The purpose of the analysis for the school district was to go through the provided disctrict data, and alter it to remove the score of certain students who attened Thomas High School. After altering the data, it is to be analyzed in order to see if the run a new analysis on the data to see if the new scores would affet the overall analysis.
### Results
#### How is the district summary affected?
Overall, there is not a significant difference between the analysis before the data was altered to replace math and reading scores for the Thomas High School students. The biggest difference, although not significant, is the difference in the percentage of those students who had a passing reading score. As can be seen in (image) the passing reading percentage was 86%, decreasing to 85.7% after the analysis was run using the fixed data.
#### How is the school summary affected?
When it comes to the school summary, there are two extreme differences when it comes to the school summary that involves Thomas High School. As can be seen in the image (Image), the percentage of students who passed both math and reading was repsectively 93.3% for math, and 97.3% for reading. After the data was replaced however, this percentage dropped by nearly 30% for both subjects, as can be seen in this (imag3).
#### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
When the data for ninth graders was changed for both subjects, math and reading, the data affected the school in a significantly negative way. The unaltered data had Thomas High Schoool with one of the highest percetage of passing students. After the data was changed, replacing the ninth graders' score however, the perentage dropped significantly, reflecting extremely negatively on the school, giving them one of the lowest passing percentages in the district.
### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
#### Math and reading scores by grade
Both math and reading scores did not see any significant changes after the scores were changed for the ninth-graders.
##### Scores by school spending
The amount of perstudent budget stayed the same after the data was changed. This did not have a big affect on the average scores per each subject, but did have a difference in the percentage of passing students. 
##### Scores by school size
As is teh case with the scores by school spending, the only real change was seen in the percentage of passing students in each subject. However, Thomas High School is one of the charter schools with the most students, and became the worst performing charter school after the change.
##### Scores by school type
When it comes to scores by school type, the average scores per subject remained similiar, however the overall percentage of passing students dropped drastically, from over 90% of students at Thomas High School passing, to only 65% of all students passing. Thomas High School also went from being one of the best performing charter schools, to one of the worst performing charter schools
## Summary:
Overall, the changes that were made to the data to account for the academic dishonesty did not have a huge difference on the average scores provided by THomas High Schoool. However, the high school did suffer greatly when it came to the percentage of students who passed both subjects, as well as the overall passing percentage of students in the school. As mentioend before, the school had a overall passing percentage of over 90%, and the changed data made this passing percentage drop by 25%, bringing it to 65%. This made Thomas High School the worst performing charter school.
